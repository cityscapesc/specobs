If you need to retain the data for longer than this time period, you can download the data for storage.",2
VIEW CHARTS,How is Occupancy calculated?,"Occupancy is a measure of a likelihood of the power of a sample being higher than the calculated noise floor at a particular time range and frequency. Considering that we can not guarantee that the station has been fully calibrated, we calculate the noise floor by taking the average of the power for the frequency that we are looking at and all the samples that we have for frequencies 50 MHz below and above the sample that we are looking at. Then we do a CDF at that point to statistically calculate the likelihood that the current frequency would be below the calculated noise floor. The occupancy at that frequency is equal to 100% minus the CDF that we calculated, which is the likelihood that the power would be above the calculated noise floor.",3
